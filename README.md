# SURVIVAL PROBABILITY IN THE TITANIC SHIP DISASTER
## This is data collected from the Titanic tragedy of 15th April 1912.
In the year 1912 the world faced one of the greatest tragedy that would come to be known by many down the years. 
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that was operated by the White Star Line. It was reported to have sank in the North Atlantic Ocean.
Having seen a machine learning competition on Kaggle of the same dataset I took upon myself to build a Gradient Boosting Classifier model to predict the survival probability of a given passenger.
The features I built on my model include age, passenger class (1st,2nd,3rd class), cabin in which the passenger stayed, place of boarding the ship, 
if the passenger came alone or had family and the gender of the passenger. With this i was able to predict the passenger who survived and got a score of 78% on my predictions.
The repository is free anyone to download the data and improve on the model.
